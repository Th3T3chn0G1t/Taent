# Taent

Just delivering some parcels, how hard could it be ;3.

Controls are WASD for movement, space for jump and click to interact/pickup.

To run on Linux - `cd` into this directory and run `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib ./Taent`.

This game was wholely developed in the [Hazel Game Engine](https://hazelengine.com/) on the Linux port I maintain! It crashed a total of 67 times while making this short game but hey we delivered. Bug reports appreciated (Please enclose logs!).

All graphics, audio and game code are my own - for better or for worse.

Exiting requires ALT+F4 for now, sorry for the inconvenience.

Thanks for playing `<3
